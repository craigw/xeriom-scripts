When I do sysadmin I tend to wrap up tasks in scripts so they're easy to
do again and again. Unfortuantely ths leaves me with scripts scattered all
over the place and I tend to lose them and have to re-do work. That's bad.

Here I attempt to gather all the scripts that I use so they can be all in one
place and version controlled. Mmm, happy scripts.
